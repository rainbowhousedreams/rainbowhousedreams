Darin will probably get a post in before this one goes up, [update: he did] but I'm really excited right now, so I wanted to write a bit.  This is the season to be thinking about what we are growing for the year.  The reference we have sitting out on the table is Portland Nursery's Veggie Calendar ([pdf](https://portlandnursery.com/docs/veggies/VeggieCalendar.pdf)).

We got a seed blocker!  Which means we never need used disposable thin plastic pots again for seed starts.  This is exciting.  I am looking forward to starting starts with this.

In a couple weeks, according to that seed guide, we will probably use this seed blocker to start arugula, endives, kale, leeks, lettuce, mustard, onions, peas, and maybe spinach.  I don't think we'll start artichoke, they take up way too much space, and if you ask my taste buds, brussels sprouts fill the same niche.  I don't have any plans for starting fava beans, but we'll see whether Darin has any thoughts on that.

Outside, we can seed radishes in January.

[On cover crops](https://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/gardening-techniques/cover-crops-zm0z11zsto), to read more closely when I'm not running out the door.  Looks like it has good advice.
