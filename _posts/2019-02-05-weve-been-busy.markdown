We got all our seeds in the mail!  Still working on the full gardening plan, but it's starting to take shape. Melons at our place, that way we can use the probably-not-fully-composted (and thus possibly but hopefully not slightly smelly?) compost on them that they like.  We'll plant them in the sunniest spot near the house, the [house will reflect a bit of extra heat back onto them](https://www.chelseagreen.com/2019/how-to-use-reflected-light-to-boost-indoor-food-production/).  Corn everywhere.  Water lovers at the community garden plot as much as possible.  Gotta transplant the community garden strawberries and thin the raspberries.  Prune the blueberries and kiwis.

We pulled up a bunch of garlic from the community garden and transplanted them at the Rainbow House into planters as separate cloves so they would each grow their own heads.  There were still a bunch left over.  A neighbor named Mary from Buy Nothing came over and helped me transplant those back into the community garden plot along the border.  So that was good.  Garlic is everywhere.  It's even on our green roof.

We're still needing to find some yards where we can grow piles and piles of sunflowers.

There's a garden coach off Buy Nothing who is going to help us come up with a planting plan for the season.  So we need to get maps of our assorted garden plots to her, and also a list of seeds we hope to plant, and also any other information we think is relevant.

Darin planted a bunch of snow peas today at Annex #2, including peas we had sprouted in water as well as pea sprouts we started in soil blocks.  I thought we needed to harden them off first, but Darin didn't.  Turns out we should have hardened them off first.  This is ok, because if they make it, only the strongest will survive, and we will have selected for peas that can go directly from an indoor climate to a snow storm.

We've been reading "[The Resilient Gardener](http://www.caroldeppe.com/Resilient%20Gardener.html)" (have we mentioned we love Chelsea Green Publishing?  We love [Chelsea Green Publishing](https://www.chelseagreen.com).  They have an affiliate program.  I have never before considered signing up for an affiliate program.  But I expect to mention like a billion more of their books, so if we had an audience, I would totally be their shill.) and the author said her favorite garden bed EVER was this lawn with heavy clay soil (Annex #2, I'm looking at you!) and she covered it with a mixture of sand and compost, and then planted mustard greens (or was it arugula?) in it, let that grow for six weeks or so 'til it was time to plant tomato starts, and then grew tomatoes.  So we are going to follow her expert lead, and get the best tomato bed ever.  This means sand-hauling is on our calendar.  Sand is heavy.  We'll be getting this stuff in bags.  Half a yard of sand would be beyond the weight limit of our trailer!

Speaking of tomatoes, [Siberia](https://www.groworganic.com/organic-tomato-siberia.html) tomato vs. [Siberian](https://www.seedsavers.org/siberian-organic-tomato) tomato, here we come!  Seed Saver's Exchange says that the Siberian tomato is, and I quote, "Not the same as Siberia, which is inferior in all respects."  Further research is required.  The earliest and tastiest tomato wins.

In other news, we finished painting the loft yesterday!  And we have couchsurfers! Next: install the plywood loft floor, vacuum it, and apply Rubio Monocoat.
