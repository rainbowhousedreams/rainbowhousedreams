{% include gallery caption="In which we harvest salt at the Oregon Coast" %}
<p>
We biked from Portland down to the Whalen Island County Campground via Champoeg Campground and the Nestucca River National Back Country Byway.  We were going to stay at Cape Lookout, but there was one more hill.  At the time, we didn't realize Jacobsen Salt does this just down the road from where we harvested.  They tested the ocean in 25 places and chose to harvest from the Netarts Bay Shellfish Preserve.  A local told us that they heard the oysters purify the water extra.  We figure the stuff not much more than 10 miles away is probably pretty ok, too.</p>
<p>We figure it takes about 2-3 standard campground bundles of wood to boil off one 5-gallon bucket of water.  The ocean is about 3% salt, so 5 gallons of water contains about a pound of salt.  A quick internet search and a bit of math tells me that, nutritionally speaking, you need definitely less than two pounds of salt, but maybe a bit more than a pound of salt per person per year.  So the salt we harvested from 10 gallons of ocean (which we did in a day, but didn't time it well, and were hot in the midday and done before the mosquitoes came out at night) should be enough for one person for a year.  </p>
<p>Next year, we will stay at Cape Lookout, harvest 20 gallons from Netarts Bay (after confirming that it's really actually ok to harvest ocean from a shellfish preserve?!), and take a couple late nights to boil the water down.  FYI, potatoes boiled over a campfire are delicious.</p>

Packing list included:
- clothes for rain
- clothes for sun
- tent, sleeping pads, sleeping bags
- piles of food
- our tamale pot and a borrowed large camping pot
- 5-gallon plastic pickle bucket from next to a deli dumpster
- bucket lid
- lighter
- 3 books per person is not enough
